VWAP (volume-weighted-average-price)

Relative Strength index (RSI) --> speed and change of price movements

Moving Average convergence divergence, e.g. relationship between 20 day sma and 100 day sma 

(kind of doubled, as we already have the sma's)

Stochastic Oscillator (compares closing price with severel key historical prices (highs, lows)) --> indicates momentum

Bollinger Bands (standard deviations of sma line (don't know which sma, but can check))

exponential moving average (more weight to recent price moves --> more responsive to new information)

put / call ratio --> not so relevant for large cap but might include anyway

some general economic indicator related to gdp growth, unemployment rate etc. --> Need to find an indicator which updates more regularly than once a month

Index Performances: SPX, sector indexes, emerging markets, small cap indexes

bid/ask spread --> provides insight into market liquidity and volatility (I think: high spread --> low liquidity)

Days until next financial data release or annual shareholder meeting
